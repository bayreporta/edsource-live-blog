,,What are some of the key lessons from the summit?,http://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Latosha-Guy.jpg,,Latosha Guy teaches English.,"Literacy is central to the Common Core. Without literacy, students can’t access English. They can’t access math. They’re not going to access the Next Generation Science Standards. What we need to do as educators is go back and augment our ability to ensure students have basic reading skills in place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Latosha Guy, King/Drew Magnet High School in Los Angeles",,,,,
,,What did you get out of today's workshop?,,,Michael Sahlman has taught 3rd through 5th grades. In reference to the keynote speech by Yvette Nicole Brown:,"I think it was great to hear from an adult about how teachers changed her life. It helps remind you that this is why I do this. Last year was a really challenging year. You walk away sometimes saying, ""Did I even make a difference?"" Some years are different. I've had kids come back (to visit) after 5th-grade who hated math, tell me that their favorite class is math. And I've had kids who needed IEPs (Individualized Education Programs) come back after being successful, knowing that I had the responsibility of making sure they were ready to go to middle school.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Michael Sahlman, Saint Phillip Neri Catholic School in Alameda",,,,,

,,What did you learn today that you will apply next year?,,,Misha Safran teaches high school French.,"Most of my students really love projects, so one of the things I want to do is to try the Flipped Classroom, which is why I attended that EdCamp session. I would do a lecture on video, then students would watch it at home. Then they can come in the next day to ask questions and make comments anonymously (on large pieces of paper on the wall). I want to do more Project Based Learning using authentic materials, such as making newspapers or videos. I'm excited to look for the support I need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Misha Safran, Northgate High School in Walnut Creek",,,,,
,,What changes are you making because of the Common Core standards?,http://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Dora-Morley-.jpg,,Dora Morley teachs 1st grade.,I’m realizing the importance of problem solving. I tend to want to teach and say everything all the time. I’m so used to giving the answer.

,,What are your biggest satisfactions and concerns regarding the Common Core?,,,Marci Gould teaches 4th grade.,"My biggest satisfaction is that kids are more excited about learning because they're able to collaborate. They're able to learn at their own levels. Kids are learning more because they're more engaged and they also don't really know they're learning a lot of times. I also like that students learn how to learn, so they can take that going forward. Things are changing so much in terms of jobs and careers. They need to find answers on their own and I think that's what Common Core is all about.<br><br>My biggest concern is not having a set curriculum or text as a basis. I spend a lot of personal time developing my own curriculum based off the Common Core standards. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Marci Gould, Buena Vista Elementary in Walnut Creek",,,,,
,,How did you overcome the challenges in switching to Common Core math?,,,Valentina Mascorro teaches 8th grade math.,"The kids hated me and Common Core the first year. Before they had multiple choice questions on the state tests; the kids did really well. All they had to do was bubble A, B, or C. The next year they had to explain why and they were, like, “What?” I never had the experience where they hated being in my class. It was like a battle. It was painful for both of us. You could see it in their eyes.  We survived. Now, I tell them we work as a team; it is as much my responsibility to help you but you have to work.

,,What did you learn from last year that you will apply to teaching this year?,http://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ElizabethLyon-teacher.jpg,,Elizabeth Lyon teaches 4th grade.,"In looking at new material last year and trying to look at the standards, we got stuck on how the content was different. This year, we want to step back, look at the big picture. The math standards really are asking kids to be able to solve a big, real-world problem and apply those smaller skills to it. As a teacher, I need not to be panicked and say, “I need to make sure you know all of those discrete skills before I turn you loose on a big problem.” I need to let you look at it, attack it, make mistakes. We’ll look at the mistakes and say, “Ah, what can we learn from that?”",,,,,,,,,,"<iframe width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217261190&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false""></iframe>",,,,,,,,,"Elizabeth Lyon, Loma Prieta Elementary School in Los Gatos",,,,,
,,What are the Common Core’s biggest challenges so far?,http://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Beverly-Ziegler.jpg,,Beverly Ziegler is a special education teacher.,"All these ideas are being thrown out without the proper training to show what these things are. The expectations are just increasing. They are really coming down on us to show results when we don’t even know what the results should look like. We have no data for which to go by. The kids are really trying hard. The don’t see end results because they think they’ve done something right, but it turns out that’s not how it’s supposed to look. So it can be very frustrating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beverly Ziegler, Warner Middle School in Westminster",,,,,
,,How has the Common Core changed your job?,,,Martha Charre teaches 5th grade.,"The Common Core has helped create a flexibility across grade levels. It’s easier for teachers to share ideas of what’s working. I also feel that we’re not “teaching to the tests” as much as we were under the old system. What is difficult to figure out is how all this is going to come together. In a sense, we are all being forced to become curriculum creators. I feel it can be easier for students to fall behind when there isn’t that uniformity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Martha Charre, Valencia Academy of Arts in Pico Rivera",,,,,
,,What has been the biggest problem with the change to Common Core standards?,http://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Judy-Ross-.jpg,,Judy Ross is a transitional kindergarten teacher.,"I think the district, like most districts, doesn’t give us enough time to digest it (Common Core). They throw a lot at you, but they don’t let you digest it well. They expect you to look at it on your own. I think they should slow down and let us implement it well.",,,,,,,,,,"<iframe width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217252599&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false""></iframe>",,,,,,,,,"Judy Ross, Glazier Elementary School in Norwalk",,,,,
